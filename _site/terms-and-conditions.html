<p><strong>Risk and Disclosure Information</strong></p>

<p>Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. For more information, please review the <a href="http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> brochure before you begin trading options. Options investors may lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short period of time.</p>

<p>Multiple leg options strategies involve additional risks and multiple commissions from your broker, and may result in complex tax treatments. Please consult your tax adviser. Implied volatility represents the consensus of the marketplace as to the future level of stock price volatility or the probability of reaching a specific price point. The Greeks represent the consensus of the marketplace as to how the option will react to changes in certain variables associated with the pricing of an option contract. There is no guarantee that the forecasts of implied volatility or the Greeks will be correct.</p>

<p>System response and access times may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other factors.</p>

You alone are responsible for evaluating the merits and risks associated with the use of codeapex.com’s systems, services or products. Content, research, tools, and stock or option symbols are for educational and illustrative purposes only and do not imply a recommendation or solicitation to buy or sell a particular security or to engage in any particular investment strategy. The projections or other information regarding the likelihood of various investment outcomes are hypothetical in nature, are not guaranteed for accuracy or completeness, do not reflect actual investment results and are not guarantees of future results. All investments involve risk, losses may exceed the principal invested, and the past performance of a security, industry, sector, market, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns.</p>

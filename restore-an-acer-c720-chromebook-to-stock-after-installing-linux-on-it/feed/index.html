					<description><![CDATA[I got this to work on an Acer C720. What I did was install Chromium OS on the machine, then followed the steps to &quot;Restore the default BIOS with stock settings.&quot; Once the bios was restored I could use the repair usb to reinstall factory chrome is.  Chromium OS is the open source equivalent to ChromeOS and it can be flashed to a USB stick. As long as you can still boot from a USB with Chromium on it, you can follow this tutorial and put your computer back good as new.  Instructions for installing Chromium can be found here: http://arnoldthebat.co.uk/wordpress/chromium-os/]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Same issue here. on an ACER Chromebook 15, CB5-571
I flashed SeaBIOS, WIndows 10 immediately boots.
I do have a very recent Backup of ChromeOS on an DD-Card, but didn&#039;t manage to geet a Backup of the Original BIOS.

There;s NO WAY I can get into BIOS Recovery, I think because the Seabios has completely overwritten the original IOS (and therefore, not showing any Chrome Recovery/Developer options.

1. I can&#039;t seem to find an original ChromeOS/Coreboot Acer CB5-571 BIOS
IS someone able to post an original BIOS-version?

2. How to flash this original BIOS to completely replace the SeaBIOS from within Windows?

I&#039;ve been reading and searching a lot, founs some info with Linux commands using Flashrom, maybe someone knows another way of going back to original ChromeOS?]]></description>

Hi, i know this was a long time ago but did ever get this sorted? im in the same position as you were. I have seabios as default and running ubuntu 14.04 ... I cannot get to recovery at all on boot, not even sure its still there. always just boot to seabios menu screen then into ubuntu

did you find a way to get your c720 back to chromeOS ?

any guides would be helpful

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeapex.com/restore-an-acer-c720-chromebook-to-stock-after-installing-linux-on-it/#comment-591&quot;&gt;JD&lt;/a&gt;.

For the verification error try using the latest version of the chromebook recovery app to create the media:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/jndclpdbaamdhonoechobihbbiimdgai&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/jndclpdbaamdhonoechobihbbiimdgai&lt;/a&gt;
Earlier versions had a bug where it would fail on verification:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=352442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=352442&lt;/a&gt;

Also is the replacement SSD a SATA 42mm M.2 / NGFF not larger than 128GB? I heard there are issues if trying to put anything larger than 128GB into the C720. Check here to make sure the replacement SSD is compatible with the C720:
